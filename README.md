# 06Challenge Weather Dashboard

## Description

I made this to be able to enter a city name and get the current weather plus the next 5 day forecast. I learned how to use an api and assigned it to elements in the html. Also how to make the api populate with jquery. I had a hard time with the local storage. The apps not completely done.


## Installation

You go to the link to my github pages to run the site. 

## Usage

To use the site you load it up and input a city into the search bar. Then you are greeted with the current forecast and a snap shot at the bottom of the next 5 days. The search is saved for later.
